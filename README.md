# Simpler ranges for C++17

Ranges in C++20 are looking unwieldy.

This is a ranges-like library for C++17 that provides zero-overhead list comprehensions with a
pipe-like syntax.

Standard containers can be filtered, transformed, passed through various algorithms, optimizing to
loops that would not be more efficient if written by hand.

The goal is to provide the tools to write more readable loops, where the intent of the programmer
is clearly communicated to the reader. Mentally simulating loops is a common but error-prone
part of reading other people's code, and indeed your own code from 3 months ago.

The library makes heavy use of modern C++17 features, so a compliant C++17 compiler is required.

## Features

- Arbitrary composability.
- Constexpr-friendly.
- No temporary heap allocations (`foo | sort() | to_vector()` only allocates into the resulting container).
- Heap allocation minimization: `reserve()` is used on resulting containers when possible.
- Open-ended generators (non-terminating, infinite ranges).
- Re-entrancy: A non-rvalue range can be used multiple times in a function.
- Compatible with standard containers (anything that supports `std::begin()` and `std::end()`).
- Compatible with standard algorithms (implicit conversion to iterator-like objects).
- Simple extensibility with custom range adapters. Just implement the `InputRange` faux-concept.
- Non-intrusive `operator|`. The ranges `foo | bar | baz` can be expressed as `baz(bar(foo))`, if
  using `operator|` would introduce ambiguous overloads.
- No dependencies beyond the standard library.
- Integration with foreign codebases (override hooks for `std::optional`, `std::remove_cvref_t`,
  assertions, etc.). Can be used as a submodule.
- Compiler support for all major compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- Zero-overhead.
- Header-only.

## Limitations (non-goals)

Other than usability concerns, these are the main differences from C++20 ranges.

- Bidirectional ranges. Ranges can only be consumed linearly in the forward direction.
- Random-access ranges. Ranges can only be consumed linearly in the forward direction.
- Internally using iterators. The internal iteration objects are modeled with an "enumerator"
  concept instead (objects that provide `next()`, `get()`, `at_end()`, etc.), which simplifies
  custom extensions. Implicit, zero-overhead conversion to iterators is provided for
  compatibility with standard algorithms and the range-based for loop syntax.
- Direct access to the data of underlying contiguous ranges (`data()` etc.).

## Compact generated code

Different compilers employ different heuristics, impacting things like inlining decisions,
auto-vectorization, register spilling, etc., and these tend to be highly sensitive to minor
code changes. For this reason, it is very hard to provide any guarantees about the generated
code.

[This example on Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/skF3-v) is a good case study. We can make the
following observations:

- For a constant argument, GCC chooses to perform constant-folding on the loop version, but
  not the range-based version.
- However, Clang decides to make the opposite decision, and does constant-folding on the
  ranges-based version, but not the loop.
- MSVC does not do any constant-folding, but *does* auto-vectories both versions, generating
  very similar code for both cases. MSVC also chooses to spill many registers to the stack,
  which may or may not impact performance in vectorized code.
- When the compilers are not able to constant-fold, the generated code is extremely similar for
  the loop-based version and the ranges-based version.

## Algorithms

- `generate()`: Generate infinite elements from lambda.
- `seq()`: Generate an infinite sequence of elements of any arithmetic types.
- `fill()`: Generate infinite copies of a value.
- `fill_n()`: Generate `n` copies of a value (like `std::fill()`).
- `transform()`: Transform elements from an input range with lambda (like `std::transform()`).
- `filter()`: Produce only elements from an input range where predicate returns true.
- `first_n()`: Produce the first `n` elements of an input range.
- `first()`: Produce the first element as an `std::optional`.
- `skip_n()`: Produce all elements from an input range after skipping `n` elements.
- `until()`: Produce elements from an input range until a predicate returns false.
- `zip()`: Produce tuples of values from multiple input ranges, until one of the ranges
   reaches its end.
- `count()`: Count number of elements in an input range.
- `foldl()`: Fold-left with initial value and lambda (like `std::accumulate()`).
- `sum()`: Sum elements of types that support `operator+`.
- `max()`: Get the maximum element, according to `std::max()`, or `std::nullopt` if the input is
  empty.
- `min()`: Get the minimum element, according to `std::min()`, or `std::nullopt` if the input is
  empty.
- `any_of()`: True if any element matches predicate.
- `all_of()`: True if all elements matches predicate.
- `none_of()`: True if no element matches predicate.
- `append()`: Append the result of an input range to an arbitrary container supporting
  `emplace_back()`, `push_back()`, or `emplace()`.
- `sort()`: Sort the elements of an input range with `std::sort()`. Does not allocate temporary
  storage, unless used as input for further algorithms.
- `uniq()`: Reduce the output by consecutive equality with `std::unique()`. Does not allocate
  temporary storage, unless used as input for further algorithms.
- `length()`: Get the length of an input range. Uses `std::size()` if possible.

## TODO

- Custom comparison functions for `min()`, `max()`, etc.
- More algorithms (`assign()`, etc.).
- Subranges: Grouping, partitioning, etc.

## Examples

Generate a sequence of 15 odd integers:

~~~c++
for (auto x: seq() | filter([](int x) { return x % 2 == 1; }) | first_n(15)) {
    // do something with x
}
~~~

Generate a map of 15 integers to their string representation.

~~~c++
// Note: Composing two infinite ranges.
auto ints = seq() | filter([](int x) { return x % 2 == 1; };
auto strings = ints | transform([](int x) { return std::to_string(x); });
auto map = zip(ints, strings) | first_n(15) | to_map();
~~~

Sort a list of integers converted to strings. Note that sorting happens in the
resulting output vector. No additional storage is

~~~c++
auto ints = std::vector{{4, 1, 6, 2, 7, 4}};
// Note: The following line will not perform any computation yet.
auto strings = ints | transform([](int x) { return std::to_string(x); });
// Note: The following line will materialize into a vector and call reserve()
// based on the size of the input, resulting in a single allocation.
auto sorted = strings | sort() | to_vector();
// => {"1"s, "2"s, "4"s, "4"s, "6"s, "7"s}
~~~
